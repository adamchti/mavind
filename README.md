# Mavind by Adam

**An ultra-lightweight, bootable desktop operating system that runs supported Windows applications.**

Mavind is a real Linux-based OS — not a simulation, not an HTML mockup. It boots on UEFI
hardware and virtual machines, loads a lightweight Wayland desktop, and runs Windows
`.exe` / `.msi` applications through an integrated Wine compatibility layer.

| Target | Goal |
|---|---|
| 💾 Disk (minimal base) | ~1 GB |
| 🧠 RAM (normal desktop) | ~2 GB or less |
| ⚡ Boot | Fast |
| 🖥️ Hardware | x86_64, UEFI, 2 GB+ RAM, low-end CPUs, integrated graphics |
| 🪟 Windows apps | `.exe`, `.msi`, portable apps via Wine |

> Targets are **targets**. Actual measured size and RAM are reported by
> [`tests/measure-size.sh`](tests/measure-size.sh) / [`tests/measure-ram.sh`](tests/measure-ram.sh)
> and tracked honestly in [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md). Mavind does not claim a number it has not measured.

| **Minder** | Lightweight file manager |
| **Mavind Settings** | Display, Sound, Network, Bluetooth, Storage, Apps, Windows Apps, Users, Security, Updates, About |
| **System Monitor** | Real RAM / CPU / disk / process data from `/proc` — never faked |
